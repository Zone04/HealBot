Healbot for Wotlk.
Forked from version 3.3.5.4

# 3.3.5.5
- Moved Debuff config to Account-wide SavedVariables, this way debuff colors can be kept from one character to another
- Added the possibility to add ID as debuff to have a distinction between debuff with the same name (mainly "Harvest Soul" from LK normal/heroic)
